# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders and is available on Kaggle. It is a highly 
imbalanced dataset with fraudulent transactions  accounting  for 0.172% of all transactions.

I have explored a few techniques to address the imbalance in the data !!! 

Clearly SMOTE+XGBoost outperformed all other approaches giving a precision of 0.87 and recall of 0.85.
